# Power your DevOps

This is an application to build and distribute email newsletters internally to a mailing list. It does this by retrieving information from a [Trello][1] list and pulling all of the cards off of it.  You can structure your lists by making use of tags, which will be displayed as separate sections in an email.



## Design and Architecture

This document will outline the architecture of this application, identifying assumptions on the layout, order, and handling of data from Trello.
